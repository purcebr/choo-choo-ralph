Run \`bd list --ready --assignee ralph --type epic --sort priority -n 100\` to see available molecule roots.

Also run \`bd list --status=in_progress --assignee=ralph\` to see what tasks other Ralph agents are currently working on.

Decide which task to work on next. Selection criteria:
1. Priority - higher priority tasks are more important (P0 before P1, etc.)
2. Avoid conflicts - if other Ralph agents have tasks in_progress, you MUST pick a completely different epic. Do NOT work on any task that is a child, parent, or sibling of an in-progress task. Stay away from the entire epic tree that another Ralph is working on.
3. If all high-priority epics are being worked on by other Ralphs, pick a lower-priority epic that is completely unrelated

Pick ONE task, claim it with \`bd update <id> --status in_progress\`, then execute it according to its description.

IMPORTANT - Finding ready steps within a molecule:
When the task description tells you to find ready steps, use:
  \`bd --no-daemon ready --mol <your-molecule-id>\`
Do NOT use \`bd ready --parent <id>\` as it will incorrectly show no results due to parent-child blocking semantics.

One iteration = complete the task AND all its child tasks (if any).

IMPORTANT: After the task and all children are done (or if blocked), EXIT immediately. Do NOT pick up another top-level task. The outer loop will handle the next iteration.
